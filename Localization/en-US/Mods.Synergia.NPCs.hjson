	Chat: {
		Text: I think that lonely life not that bad. Sometimes I think i was kicked out for a reason and for better life. Better to be honest with yourself, than to live in a lie.
		Text1: Interesting to hear all these lying stories. I hope you didn't believe'em
		Text2: I don't truly know what's happening here, in this abandoned and collapsed place, but I feel confident that no one will disturb me.
		Text3: On the one of the signs was written that here lived a race of people-demons. What you think, these stories are real?
		Text4: But one thing I know for sure, there is enormous cave nearby. This cave is shelter of the Wyrm, those living here considered him a demigod, but he destroyed �em and their faith.
		Text5: Interesting, what's hidden under this bridge? Monsters can't let me dive in, maybe I can find something?
		Text6: The real reason why I was chased away that they think I'm a traitor.
		Text7: But I'm not a traitor or a something. Heart of The Tundra, which was sealed in an ancient Ice Monument, was exchanged for protection and stolen by Jotunn
		Text8: Heart of the Tundra is an ancient artifact which was protected by dwarves for decades
